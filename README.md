# video-conference-system
 The main purpose of system is to enable face-to-face communication between two or more people in 
different locations. Video conferencing boosts productivity, saves time, reduces travel expenses, and 
overall promotes collaboration. The advantage of video conferencing is the ability to facilitate all of those 
benefits without requiring constant travel for face-to-face communication. It is a popular alternative to 
phone conferencing for businesses and provides individual users with an inexpensive means of 
communication with distant friends and family. People from around the world can connect through many 
different ways. They can connect through one or two way audio, one or two way video, one or two way 
audio and video or through text. Basically, the purpose of making the video conference system project is 
to flow its main features and update the new features in it.


 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS : 
	Almost all academic institutions require attendance record of students and maintaining attendance manually can be hectic as well as time consuming task. Hence maintaining attendance automatically with the help of face recognition will be very helpful and less prone to errors as compared to manual process. This will also reduce manipulation of attendance record done by students and it will save time as well. The future scope of the proposed work can be, capturing multiple detailed images of the students and using any cloud technology to store these images. The system can be configured and used in Atm machines to detect frauds.Also, the system can be used at the time of elections where the voter can be identified by recognizing the face.

 FACE RECOGNISATION MODEL :
	Face recognition is a method to identify or verify the identity of an individual using their face. Face recognition has  been  used  for  various  applications  such  as  automatic  classroom  attendance  management  system,  surveillance of access restricted zones including living spaces for intruder detection, recognition of celebrities in  public  space,  recognition  of  house  inmates  by  networked  home  automation  system and  many  more.  Most  of  the  face  recognition  systems  designed  consist  of  two  major  modules:  feature  extraction  and  classifier. The conventional methods like Eigenfaces and Fisher faces are sensitive to lighting, noise, posture, obstruction, illumination etc, whereas Convolutional  Neural  Network  (CNN)  is  a  deep  learning  algorithm,  most  commonly  used in applications using images, because it performs the combined task of feature extraction and classification. Hence in this project, we first capture an image of person and utilize the OpenCV module to detect and frame the faces in that image. In the next stage we enhance these frames using an image enhancing model. In the final stage, we build a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to train these facial images and using the camera we can detect the person and make attendance in the exel sheet.
