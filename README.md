 The main purpose of system is to enable face-to-face communication between two or more people in 
different locations. Video conferencing boosts productivity, saves time, reduces travel expenses, and 
overall promotes collaboration. The advantage of video conferencing is the ability to facilitate all of those 
benefits without requiring constant travel for face-to-face communication. It is a popular alternative to 
phone conferencing for businesses and provides individual users with an inexpensive means of 
communication with distant friends and family. People from around the world can connect through many 
different ways. They can connect through one or two way audio, one or two way video, one or two way 
audio and video or through text. Basically, the purpose of making the video conference system project is 
to flow its main features and update the new features in it.
